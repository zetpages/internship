## Frontend Test

### Introduction

Welcome to a simple PSD to HTML task. Please read in detail this document.

### What to do next

- Open the "frontend-test.png" file to see what is expected from you to deliver, this file includes behavior guidelines that you will need to implement
- The source files are frontend-test.psd and frontend-test-mobile.psd
- Open the "frontend.json" file to get the variables you'll need to connect as assets to the work
- Push all your works of this task to `/task#5-fronted-test/solution/`

#### Bonus
- On top of that we would also like you to create a parallax effect for the hero section (desktop only) similar to the one shown in [parallax_demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1InYqblOtu13HjBDcrOdB5M750TYUvqYZ/view?usp=sharing)

### Transitions

The test doesn't describe the transitions and animations, please do make sure to add animations to make the transitions smoother.

### What we look for in your delivery

- We are looking for pixel perfect delivery, make sure to match everything exactly as it is in the design.
- We expect the code to be minimal, very organized and linted. We won't accept "Spaghetti" code even if the frontend looks perfect. Keep in mind that your code when working with us will be sliced to sections and integrated into WordPress, make the backend developer life easier.
- It goes without saying the delivery should be responsive to support all device resolutions
- Other than the behavior explained in "frontend-test.png", we would like to have a parallax effect fo the hero image. The image is set to different layers in the PSD - "frontend-test.psd" and we would like to have a similar behavior as the one in the demo the how the different layers will behave on the hero section while scrolling.

### What we will test in your delivery

- Check pixel-perfect layout according to the provided design.
- Apply various ratios and layouts to test responsiveness of assets.
